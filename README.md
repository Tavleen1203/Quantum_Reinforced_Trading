## Overview

The project leverages:
- **OpenAI's Gym**: To create a simulated trading environment.
- **Google's Cirq**: For designing and executing quantum circuits.
- **Alpha Vantage API**: To fetch historical daily stock data.

## Features

- **Adaptive Trading Strategies**: Utilizes QRL for efficient decision-making.
- **Quantum Circuit Design**: Enhances trading strategy with quantum mechanics.
- **Risk Management**: Employs an epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-trading.git
   cd quantum-trading
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Set up your Alpha Vantage API key in `config.py`:
   ```python
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Results

The project evaluates the QRL model's performance using:
- Cumulative Return
- Sharpe Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
